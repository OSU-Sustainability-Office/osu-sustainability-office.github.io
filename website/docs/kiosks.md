## QR Codes

Use [this website](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com) for generating new QR codes (if needed), for the `/#/sec` page (https://osu-sustainability-office.github.io/sustainability-kiosks/#/sec)

- According to [their About Page](https://www.qrcode-monkey.com/#about), you get links that last forever (no expiring), and no need to make an account or pay to use it
