## Contributing

- Any Frontend work is open to PR's / open source
- Anything touching backend, including our NodeJS server (running locally), running AWS backend locally, or running AWS CRON jobs (for automated-jobs) can only be done by paid OSU Sustainability Office employees for security reasons
- Open source contributors can run the production API endpoints for energy-dashboard and carbon-calculator, for debugging frontend-only issues
