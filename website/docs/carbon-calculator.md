# Carbon Calculator

## Backend

- [Reference this Github Issue](https://github.com/OSU-Sustainability-Office/osu_carbon_calculator_update_project/issues/39)
  - Covers `await` for backend API calls, CORS debugging, local debugging tips
  - [Referenced PR (#38)](https://github.com/OSU-Sustainability-Office/osu_carbon_calculator_update_project/pull/38)
  - [Referenced PR (#41)](https://github.com/OSU-Sustainability-Office/osu_carbon_calculator_update_project/pull/41)

## Math Issues

- [Reference this directory in local-testing-v2 branch](https://github.com/OSU-Sustainability-Office/osu_carbon_calculator_update_project/tree/local-testing-v2/backend/app/carbon/data-backup)
- Coefficients are a black box, no idea on the math here
  - [References to a now-deleted spreadsheet for calculations](https://github.com/OSU-Sustainability-Office/osu_carbon_calculator_update_project/blob/4bc17d07dc2aba83c08513e2d1aa222ab024200c/README.md)
  - [Maybe helpful document for calculations](https://github.com/OSU-Sustainability-Office/osu_carbon_calculator_update_project/tree/4d351d539b1fbfb8d114f236a953c157b84e3ad9/download)
    - Download `.doc` file. Not very helpful though for connecting to the current coefficients, that went through a round of further calculation refinements that are now lost (tracked on the deleted spreadsheet, according to old README comments)
